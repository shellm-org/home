`home` helps you manage all your shell scripts and libraries in one place.
Putting them all in this one place allows easy synchronisation
between multiple machine by versioning the directory
with git or another version-control system.

## Motivation
I'll mainly speak about my own experience,
but I'm sure most of you can relate to it.

My usecases:

1. Since I moved to Linux, back in 2011,
   I grew quite a collection of shell scripts
   and personalised a lot my shell environment.
2. I use many different machines: remote servers, home computer,
   work computer, laptop, friends laptops, VMs.

My requirements:

1. I want to feel at home on each of these machine. I want my shell environment wherever I am.
2. I want it easily synced, and easily installed on new systems.

`home` aims at solving that.
